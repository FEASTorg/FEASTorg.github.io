## Overview

### Supporting Resources & Tools

- [KNEEAD](/KNEEAD/)  
  Knowledge for Navigating Electrical & Electronic Architecture and Design. A comprehensive knowledge base featuring hardware guidelines, best practices, review checklists, design conventions, hardware patterns, architectural principles, and supporting tools such as Python-powered calculators & JupyterLite demos.

- [KiCad-Master-Lib](/KiCad-Master-Lib/)  
  Centralized and curated library of schematic symbols, PCB footprints, and templates for use with KiCad.

- [KiCad-Hierarchical-Designs](/KiCad-Hierarchical-Designs/)  
  Reference designs demonstrating best practices for hierarchical schematic structures and modular PCB design in KiCad.

- [KiCad-Simulation-Examples](/KiCad-Simulation-Examples/)  
  Collection of simulation-ready examples and tutorials for circuit validation and analysis using KiCadâ€™s integrated simulation features.

### Functional Implementation Domains

- [BREADS](/BREADS/)  
  "breads"

  Hardware domain of FEAST, defining standards for SLICE function cards and LOAF controllers.

- [FROOTS](/FROOTS/)  
  "fruits"
