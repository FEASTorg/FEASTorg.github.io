## Concept Overview

FEAST: Flexible and Expandable Automation System Technology

### Supporting Resources & Tools

- [KNEEAD](/KNEEAD/)

  Knowledge for Navigating Electrical & Electronic Architecture and Design.

  A comprehensive knowledge base featuring hardware guidelines, best practices, review checklists, design conventions, hardware patterns, architectural principles, and supporting tools such as Python-powered calculators & JupyterLite demos.

- [KiCad-Master-Lib](/KiCad-Master-Lib/)

  Centralized and curated library of schematic symbols, PCB footprints, and templates for use with KiCad.

- [KiCad-Hierarchical-Designs](/KiCad-Hierarchical-Designs/)

  Reference designs demonstrating best practices for hierarchical schematic structures and modular PCB design in KiCad.

- [KiCad-Simulation-Examples](/KiCad-Simulation-Examples/)

  Collection of simulation-ready examples and tutorials for circuit validation and analysis using KiCadâ€™s integrated simulation features.

### Functional Implementation Domains

- [BREADS](/BREADS/)

  Broadly Expandable and Reconfigurable Data Acquisition and Automation Device Standard or "breads" encompasses the hardware domain. It defines the electromechanical specifications for compatible hardware. Implementations include: SLICE function cards CRUST interface bridges, and LOAF controllers & backplanes.

- [FROOTS](/FROOTS/)

  Firmware for Resilient, (Function-)Oriented Operation of Things Specification or "fruits" encompasses the firmware domain. It defines standardized logic, interfaces and modules for hardware operation.

- [PROTINS](/PROTINS/)

  Programmable Runtime Orchestration and Transport Interfaces for Node Supervision or "proteins" encompasses the middleware domain. It provides runtime orchestration, device management, and modular drivers to bridge the gap between device firmware and user-defined software.

- [SUGIRS](/SUGIRS/)

  "sugars" is the software/interface domain. It's purpose is enabling user interaction, system monitoring, control interfaces, and remote scheduling.

### Hierarchical System Levels

- [SLICE](/SLICE/)  
  "slice"

  Single-function Logic Interface & Controller Element. Single-function PCBs with onboard processing and communication capabilities.

- [LOAF](/LOAF/)  
  "loaf"

  Locally Operated Automation Framework. Integrates multiple SLICE modules to create localized subsystems.

- [BATCH](/BATCH/)  
  "batch"

  Bridged Architecture for Task Control & Handling. Manages coordination among multiple LOAF systems to perform complex processes.

- [OVEN](/OVEN/)  
  "oven"

  Orchestrated Versatile Embedded Network. Networks multiple BATCH-level systems to achieve broader organizational or operational goals.
