As we kick off 2026, I wanted to share some exciting updates on the progress we've made with FEASTorg and outline our plans for the year ahead.

## KiCad-Master-Lib

The KiCad-Master-Lib repository has seen significant enhancements over the past few months. The organization and standardization of footprints and symbols have been a major focus, ensuring that the library is both clear for users and positioned to grow with future contributions. Now all symbols, footprints, and 3D models are stored within named subdirectories. Furthermore, the repo previously known as KiCad-Hierarchical-Designs has been merged into KiCad-Master-Lib under `kmlib-local/blocks`, streamlining our resources and making it easier for users to find what they need.

In addition, we've added numerous new components, improved existing footprints, and refined our documentation to make it easier for users to get started. If you haven't checked it out recently, I encourage you to explore the latest additions and updates.

## Main Site Improvements

A large change has been the archiving of the "Implementation Domains" and "System Levels" pages. These pages served their purpose during the initial phases of FEASTorg while I explored the area and organization of the stack but have now been retired to streamline our documentation as we have progressed away from the exact ideas presented in those pages.
