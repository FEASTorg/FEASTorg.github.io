## FEAST Projects

The FEAST ecosystem includes several project repositories that provide tools, resources, and example implementations to support the broader automation framework:

- [ProtoKit](/protokit/)

  **ProtoKit** provides prototyping tools and utilities for rapid development and testing of FEAST-compatible hardware and software components.

- [DevBoardDepot](/devboarddepot/)

  **DevBoardDepot** is a collection of development boards, reference designs, and evaluation platforms that demonstrate FEAST implementation patterns and facilitate system development.
