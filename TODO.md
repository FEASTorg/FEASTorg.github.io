# TODO

- [ ] Freeboard transfer from personal

- [ ] Update all protokit examples to use proto.pretty from KiCad-Master-Lib

- [ ] KNEEAD clean up and improve UX

- [ ] Repository/Organization Concept Map: show relationships between projects and illustrate organizational structure

- [ ] Dependency Map: Project interconnections & Technology stack relationships

- [ ] [KiCad-RPi-HAT](https://github.com/FEASTorg/KiCad-RPi-HAT)

- [ ] [KiCad-Simulation-Examples](https://github.com/FEASTorg/KiCad-Simulation-Examples)

- [ ] [KiCad-Databases](https://github.com/FEASTorg/KiCad-Databases)

- [ ] rename from FEASTorg to feast-labs? Note that [github.com/feast-dev](https://github.com/feast-dev) is a taken and well established name for the feast-dev ML feature store project. Maybe feast-group? Or another idea would be to rename to feast-org or feast-hq?
