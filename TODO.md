# TODO

- [x] Add KNEEAD to navigation bar (external link needs redirect setup)

- [ ] KiCad-Hierarchical-Designs change to KiCad-Design-Blocks ? Using KiCad's [Schematic Design Blocks](https://docs.kicad.org/9.0/ca/eeschema/eeschema.html#schematic-design-blocks) or would it be better as a separate project? Need to investigate further.

- [ ] proto.pretty move the lib out of Protokit and into KiCad-Master-Lib? Then use in Protokit and in the Slice_PRTO_XYZ projects?

- Add the MVP documentation for the following projects and how they fit into the FEAST ecosystem and relate to each other:
  - [ ] Breakout Pack
  - [ ] ProtoKit
  - [ ] DevBoard Depot

- [ ] Repository/Organization Concept Map: show relationships between projects and illustrate organizational structure

- [ ] Dependency Map
  - Project interconnections
  - Technology stack relationships

- [ ] KNEEAD clean up and improve UX
- [ ] Freeboard transfer from personal
