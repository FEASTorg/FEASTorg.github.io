# TODO

- [x] Add KNEEAD to navigation bar (external link needs redirect setup)

- [x] proto.pretty move the lib out of Protokit and into KiCad-Master-Lib? Then use in Protokit and in the Slice_PRTO_XYZ projects?

- [x] KiCad-Hierarchical-Designs change to KiCad-Design-Blocks ? Using KiCad's [Schematic Design Blocks](https://docs.kicad.org/9.0/ca/eeschema/eeschema.html#schematic-design-blocks) or would it be better as a separate project? Need to investigate further.

- [x] Update all Slice_PRTO_XYZ projects to use proto.pretty from KiCad-Master-Lib

- [x] Update all templates to use revised KMLib

- [x] Clean up concepts:
  - VEGIS and CRUST
  - The 2 stacks
  - SLICE, LOAF, BATCH, OVEN
  - SLICE, FROOTS, PROTINS, SIGARS
  - Retain as a future vision / prior ideas / brainstorming section in the documentation?

- [ ] Update all protokit to use proto.pretty from KiCad-Master-Lib and build schematics for those that don't have them yet where it makes sense (i.e. project boards)

- Add the MVP documentation for the following projects and how they fit into the FEAST ecosystem and relate to each other:
  - [ ] BreakoutPack
  - [ ] protokit
  - [ ] DevBoardDepot
  - [ ] Maybe merge all these for now under a mono-repo?
  - [ ] Now does it related to nanos-kicad and can-nano-shield?
  - Maybe
    - Devboarddepot and nanos kicad could be merged?
    - Breakoutpack and protokit could be merged?
    - Then for hardware we have proto?, nanos?, breads (slice+loaf)

- [ ] Freeboard transfer from personal

- [ ] Update all protokit examples to use proto.pretty from KiCad-Master-Lib

- [ ] KNEEAD clean up and improve UX

- [ ] Repository/Organization Concept Map: show relationships between projects and illustrate organizational structure

- [ ] Dependency Map: Project interconnections & Technology stack relationships

- [ ] [KiCad-RPi-HAT](https://github.com/FEASTorg/KiCad-RPi-HAT)

- [ ] [KiCad-Simulation-Examples](https://github.com/FEASTorg/KiCad-Simulation-Examples)

- [ ] [KiCad-Databases](https://github.com/FEASTorg/KiCad-Databases)

- [ ] rename from FEASTorg to feast-labs? Note that [github.com/feast-dev](https://github.com/feast-dev) is a taken and well established name for the feast-dev ML feature store project.
