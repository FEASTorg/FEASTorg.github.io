# TODO

- [x] Add KNEEAD to navigation bar (external link needs redirect setup)

- [x] proto.pretty move the lib out of Protokit and into KiCad-Master-Lib? Then use in Protokit and in the Slice_PRTO_XYZ projects?

- [x] KiCad-Hierarchical-Designs change to KiCad-Design-Blocks ? Using KiCad's [Schematic Design Blocks](https://docs.kicad.org/9.0/ca/eeschema/eeschema.html#schematic-design-blocks) or would it be better as a separate project? Need to investigate further.

- [ ] Update all Slice_PRTO_XYZ projects to use proto.pretty from KiCad-Master-Lib

- Add the MVP documentation for the following projects and how they fit into the FEAST ecosystem and relate to each other:
  - [ ] BreakoutPack
  - [ ] ProtoKit
  - [ ] DevBoardDepot
  - [ ] CircuitBlocks
  - [ ] Maybe merge all these for now under a mono-repo?

- [ ] Update all ProtoKit examples to use proto.pretty from KiCad-Master-Lib

- [ ] Repository/Organization Concept Map: show relationships between projects and illustrate organizational structure

- [ ] Dependency Map: Project interconnections& Technology stack relationships

- [ ] KNEEAD clean up and improve UX

- [ ] Freeboard transfer from personal
