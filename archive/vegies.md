## VEGIES

**Versatile External Gear, Interfaces, and Experimental Subsystems** or _"vegies"_ is a conceptual framework for user-fabricated hardware that can integrate with BREADS-compatible systems. This includes DIY sensors, actuators, and tools made through various fabrication methods like 3D printing, digital manufacturing, and component modification. Conceptually, these are used by the BREADS hardware domain and would be considered as "below" BREADS in the hierarchy (VEGIES -> BREADS -> FROOTS -> PROTINS -> SUGIRS).

## Overview

**VEGIES** (Versatile External Gear, Interfaces, and Experimental Subsystems) is a forward-looking concept for extending FEAST capabilities through user-fabricated hardware components.

> _This is a conceptual framework intended to inspire future development and community contributions._

## What is VEGIES?

- Pronounced like "veggies"
- Represents **off-board, user-fabricated hardware** compatible with BREADS systems
- Encompasses DIY sensors, actuators, and tools created or modified by users
- Supports various manufacturing methods:
  - Additive manufacturing (3D printing)
  - Digital fabrication
  - Modified commercial components
  - Custom-built devices
