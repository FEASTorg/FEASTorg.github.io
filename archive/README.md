## Archive

This section contains archived concepts and documentation from earlier phases of the FEAST project. These materials represent the exploration and evolution of ideas during the initial development of FEASTorg.

While these concepts are no longer part of the active project structure, they are preserved here for historical reference and to document the development process.
