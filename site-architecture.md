# Site Architecture

Sites generated adhock are listed below, this is because they will pollute the search (repetitive like slices or deep dev docs like freeboard monorep) and already have complex ci which would add significant complexity:

- Slice_XXXX pages
- freeboard

The rest are pulled into this repo and built as a monolithic site and for example will be searchable.
