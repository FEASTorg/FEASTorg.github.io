FEASTorg (Flexible and Expandable Automation System Technology Organization) is an open-source initiative dedicated to creating modular, scalable automation solutions. Our mission is to develop and maintain standardized frameworks that enable seamless integration of hardware, firmware, and software components in automation systems.

## Our Vision

We believe in:

- **Open Standards**: Creating accessible, well-documented specifications for automation systems
- **Modularity**: Enabling plug-and-play compatibility between different system components
- **Scalability**: Supporting solutions from single-function devices to facility-wide systems
- **Community-Driven Development**: Fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing

## Project Structure

Our ecosystem is organized into distinct but interconnected domains:

- **Hardware** (BREADS): Standardized hardware specifications and implementations
- **Firmware** (FROOTS): Embedded software frameworks and protocols
- **Middleware** (PROTINS): System integration and device management
- **Software** (SUGIRS): User interfaces and system control
