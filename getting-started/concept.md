## FEAST Design Concepts

Understanding these core design concepts is essential for effectively using FEAST to build automation systems.

## Layered Architecture

FEAST uses a layered approach where each layer provides services to the layer above it:

1. **Hardware Layer (BREADS)**: Physical devices, sensors, actuators, and mechanical interfaces
2. **Firmware Layer (FROOTS)**: Device control logic, real-time operations, and hardware abstraction
3. **Middleware Layer (PROTINS)**: Device orchestration, communication protocols, and runtime management
4. **Software Layer (SUGIRS)**: User interfaces, monitoring systems, and business logic

## Hierarchical Organization

Systems are organized hierarchically to manage complexity and enable scalability:

- **Module Level (SLICE)**: Single-function modules (e.g., temperature sensor, motor controller)
- **Device Level (LOAF)**: Local systems combining multiple SLICE modules to form a cohesive device (e.g., standalone machine, test bench)
- **System Level (BATCH)**: Coordinated groups of LOAF devices working together as an integrated system (e.g., production line, multi-station cell)
- **Facility Level (OVEN)**: Facility-wide networks of BATCH systems (e.g., entire factory, campus)

## Standardized Interfaces

All FEAST components use standardized interfaces to ensure interoperability:

- **Communication Protocols**: Consistent data exchange formats and network protocols
- **Mechanical Interfaces**: Standard connectors, mounting systems, and physical dimensions
- **Software APIs**: Uniform programming interfaces across all software components
- **Configuration Methods**: Common approaches to device setup and parameter management
- **Behavioral Models**: Standardized description and programming of control patterns and execution sequences

## Modularity Principles

Components are designed to be modular and composable:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clearly defined function
- **Loose Coupling**: Components interact through well-defined interfaces
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped together
- **Plug-and-Play**: Components can be easily added, removed, or replaced

## Open Standards Approach

FEAST specifications are developed as open standards:

- **Transparent Development**: All specifications developed in public repositories
- **Community Input**: Stakeholders can participate in the design process
- **Vendor Neutral**: No dependence on proprietary technologies or vendors
- **Future Evolution**: Standards evolve based on real-world usage and feedback

## Implementation Strategy

When building FEAST systems, follow this strategy:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple SLICE-level implementations
2. **Validate Early**: Test individual components before system integration
3. **Scale Gradually**: Add complexity incrementally as you gain experience
4. **Follow Standards**: Adhere to FEAST specifications for maximum compatibility
5. **Document Everything**: Maintain clear documentation for future maintenance

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the core concepts, proceed to the [Usage](/usage/) section to learn how to apply these concepts when building your own automation systems.
