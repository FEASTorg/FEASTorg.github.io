## Introduction to FEAST

FEAST (Flexible and Expandable Automation System Technology) is a comprehensive framework for building modular, scalable automation systems. It provides standardized specifications across hardware, firmware, middleware, and software domains.

## Core Philosophy

FEAST is built on four fundamental principles:

- **Modularity**: Components can be mixed and matched to create custom solutions
- **Scalability**: Systems can grow from single devices to facility-wide networks
- **Interoperability**: Standardized interfaces ensure seamless component integration
- **Open Standards**: All specifications are openly documented and community-driven

## Benefits

- **Reduced Development Time**: Reuse proven components and patterns
- **Lower Costs**: Avoid proprietary vendor lock-in with open standards
- **Easier Maintenance**: Standardized interfaces simplify troubleshooting
- **Future-Proof**: Modular design adapts to changing requirements

## Who Uses FEAST?

FEAST is designed for:

- Automation engineers building custom systems
- Researchers developing new automation technologies
- Scientists who want full control over their lab and experimental setups
- Manufacturers seeking flexible production solutions
- Students learning automation system design

## Next Steps
