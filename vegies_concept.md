# VEGIES Concept

**_Future..._**

- **VEGIES**: Versatile External Gear, Interfaces, and Experimental Subsystems

  - Pronounced like "veggies"
  - Refers to **off-board, user-fabricated hardware** that can be used in BREADS-compatible systems
  - Includes sensors, actuators, and tools made or modified by users (e.g., DIY sensors and actuators, additive or other digitally manufactured parts, hacked devices and components)

  - Ideas for implementations:
    - Handmade thermocouples
    - DIY pH/ORP/EC probes
    - DIY optical turbidity sensors using LED + photodiode in 3D printed holder
    - Capacitive soil moisture sensors with etched foil or PCB traces
    - Printed or milled strain gauge structures
    - Homemade load cells using strain gauges on flexures
    - Thermistor or RTD sensor assemblies in waterproof housings
    - 3D-printed linear actuators with screw drives or sliders
    - DIY stepper or brushed motors from recycled components
    - Custom solenoid valves with 3D printed bodies
    - Servo/solenoid-driven micro-dispensers for fluids or reagents
    - Magnetic stirrers or vibratory actuators with scrap coils
    - Modular sensor mounts and probe holders (3D printed)
    - Custom wire harnesses, pogo-pin adapters, breakout jigs
    - Printable mechanical positioning systems for probe insertion
    - Environmental test enclosures with integrated sensing (e.g. temp/humidity)
    - Electrochemical cells with swappable electrodes using common components
    - Low-cost microfluidic chips cut from acrylic or molded in PDMS
    - DIY cuvettes or optical measurement paths for colorimetry
    - Textile-based biosensors or conductive gel patches for touch/contact sensing
