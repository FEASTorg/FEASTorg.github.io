## Overview

**VEGIES** (Versatile External Gear, Interfaces, and Experimental Subsystems) is a forward-looking concept for extending FEAST capabilities through user-fabricated hardware components.

> _This is a conceptual framework intended to inspire future development and community contributions._

## What is VEGIES?

- Pronounced like "veggies"
- Represents **off-board, user-fabricated hardware** compatible with BREADS systems
- Encompasses DIY sensors, actuators, and tools created or modified by users
- Supports various manufacturing methods:
  - Additive manufacturing (3D printing)
  - Digital fabrication
  - Modified commercial components
  - Custom-built devices

## Potential Implementation Ideas

### Sensing Solutions
