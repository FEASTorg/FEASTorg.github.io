## Identifying Your Automation Goal

Before selecting FEAST components, clearly define what you want to automate and establish success criteria for your project.

## Define the Problem

Start by answering these fundamental questions:

- **What process needs automation?** Be specific about the current manual process
- **What are the pain points?** Identify inefficiencies, errors, or safety concerns
- **What outcomes do you want?** Define measurable improvements you expect
- **What constraints exist?** Consider budget, space, time, and regulatory requirements

## Establish Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Input/Output Specifications**: What signals, data, or materials go in and out?
- **Processing Requirements**: What operations or transformations are needed?
- **Performance Criteria**: Speed, accuracy, throughput, and reliability expectations
- **Interface Requirements**: How will users interact with the system?

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Environmental Conditions**: Temperature, humidity, vibration, electromagnetic interference
- **Safety Requirements**: Safety standards, emergency procedures, fail-safe mechanisms
- **Maintenance Needs**: Accessibility, diagnostic capabilities, scheduled maintenance
- **Scalability Needs**: Future expansion possibilities and growth requirements

## Scope Definition

### Project Boundaries

Define what is included and excluded from your automation project:

- **In Scope**: Specific processes, equipment, and interfaces to be automated
- **Out of Scope**: Processes that will remain manual or be addressed in future phases
- **Dependencies**: External systems or processes that your automation relies on

### Success Metrics

Establish measurable criteria for project success:

- **Performance Metrics**: Quantifiable improvements in speed, quality, or efficiency
- **Cost Metrics**: Return on investment, operational cost reductions
- **Quality Metrics**: Error reduction, consistency improvements
- **Safety Metrics**: Incident reduction, compliance improvements

## Stakeholder Analysis

Identify everyone affected by your automation project:

- **Primary Users**: People who will operate the automated system daily
- **Secondary Users**: People who will maintain, configure, or troubleshoot the system
- **Decision Makers**: People who approve budget, timeline, and specifications
- **Affected Parties**: People whose work will change due to the automation

## Risk Assessment

Consider potential challenges and mitigation strategies:

### Technical Risks

- **Complexity Risk**: Is the automation more complex than your team can handle?
- **Integration Risk**: Will the automation integrate properly with existing systems?
- **Performance Risk**: Will the system meet performance requirements?

### Operational Risks

- **Training Risk**: Can users be adequately trained on the new system?
- **Maintenance Risk**: Can the system be properly maintained with available resources?
- **Dependency Risk**: What happens if the automation fails?

## Documentation Template

Create a project charter document that includes:

```md
Project Name: [Your automation project name]

Problem Statement:
[Brief description of the problem being solved]

Success Criteria:

- Metric 1: [Specific, measurable goal]
- Metric 2: [Specific, measurable goal]
- ...

Functional Requirements:

- Requirement 1: [Specific capability needed]
- Requirement 2: [Specific capability needed]
- ...

Constraints:

- Budget: [Available budget and funding source]
- Timeline: [Project deadline and key milestones]
- Technical: [Technical limitations or requirements]
- Regulatory: [Compliance requirements]

Stakeholders:

- Primary Users: [Who will use the system]
- Project Sponsor: [Who approved the project]
- Technical Team: [Who will implement the system]
```

## Next Steps

Once you have clearly defined your automation goal, proceed to [Selecting Components](/usage/selecting-components/) to choose the right FEAST components for your specific requirements.
